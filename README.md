# tectonic-typesetting.github.io

This repository contains the source files for the Tectonic website.


## Testing Locally

This site is based on a standard [Jekyll] static site system. As of this writing
(September 2022), Jekyll is [stuck on Ruby 2.7][ref1], while most of the rest of
the world has moved on to the Ruby 3.x series. You may need to set up and use a
custom environment with Ruby 2.7 (and C/C++ compilers for building binary gems),
e.g.:

```
conda activate ruby27
```

[Jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/
[ref1]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/error-no-implicit-conversion-of-hash-into-integer/5890/4

Once youâ€™ve dealt with that, run:

```
bundle install --binstubs=_bin
```

To run this website as a developer:

```
_bin/jekyll serve
```

This will serve the site at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).
