<p>For those new to it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> is
  a programming language that you use to create <i>typeset documents</i>
  rather than computer software. TeX is quite archaic in some ways, but it’s
  still the tool of choice for documents that require precision typography or
  ones that involve lots of mathematical equations, which makes it especially
  important in the sciences. Tectonic converts TeX files
  into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF</a>
  files.</p>

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">Tectonic is <b>beta software</b> but
  has been demonstrated to work well in a variety of real-world situations.
  Contributions in any form — documentation, bug reports, test cases, new
  features — are most welcome.
  The <a href="https://www.github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/issues/">GitHub
  issue tracker</a> is the place to start.</p>

<h1>What’s in it for me?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Tectonic <b>automatically downloads support files</b> so you don’t have
    to install a full LaTeX system in order to start using it. If you start
    using a new LaTeX package, Tectonic just pulls down the files it needs and
    continues processing. The underyling “bundle” technology allows
    for <b>completely reproducible document compiles</b>. <i>Thanks
    to <a href="https://bintray.com/">JFrog Bintray</a> for hosting the large
      LaTeX resource files!</i></li>
  <li>Tectonic has sophisticated logic and <b>automatically loops TeX and
      BibTeX</b> as needed, and only as much as needed. In its default mode
      it <b>doesn’t write TeX’s intermediate files</b> and <b>always produces
      a fully-processed document</b>.
  <li>The <tt>tectonic</tt> command-line program is <b>quiet and never
      stops to ask for input</b>.</li>
  <li>Thanks to the power of XeTeX, Tectonic can use <b>modern OpenType
      fonts</b> and is <b>fully Unicode-enabled</b>.</li>
  <li>The Tectonic engine has been extracted into a <b>completely
      self-contained library</b> so that it can be embedded in other
      applications.</li>
  <li>Tectonic has been forked from the old-fashioned WEB2C implementation
    of TeX and is <b>developed in the open</b>
    on <a href="https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/">GitHub</a>
    using modern tools like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">the Rust
    language</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the name</h1>

<p>The name of the project is “Tectonic,” spelled and pronounced like a
  regular word because it is one. Enough with the cutesy obscurantism. In
  cases where the name might lead to ambiguities, it should be expanded to
  “Tectonic typesetting.”</p>

<p>If you’re feeling expansive, you can interpret the name as suggesting a
  large change in the TeX world. Or you can think of it as suggesting a
  salubrious offering for weary TeX users. Either way, the root of the word
  does go back to the ancient Greek τέκτων, ”carpenter,” which Donald Knuth —
  the creator of TeX and a devout Christian — might appreciate.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Tectonic would not have been possible without <i>decades’</i> worth of hard
  work by the people behind <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>,
  <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeXLive</a>,
  <a href="http://xetex.sourceforge.net/">XeTeX</a>,
  and <a href="http://project.ktug.org/dvipdfmx/">(x)dvipdfm-x</a>. We stand
  on the shoulders of giants!</p>

  bundles of LaTeX resource files that enable Tectonic’s web-download
  capabilities.</p>
