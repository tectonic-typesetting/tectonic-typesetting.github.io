title: Learn about TeX, LaTeX, and Tectonic
---

Tectonic is just one piece of the huge and venerable TeX/LaTeX ecosystem.
There’s a lot to learn!

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">We have begun work on <b><a
href="/book/">The Tectonic Book</a></b>, which we hope will one day serve as
the definitive Tectonic manual and reference. It is currently quite sparse —
requests for content are welcome!</p>

While we work on the book, here are some topics to get you started.

- [Learn how to write LaTeX documents](#how-to-write-latex-documents)
- [Learn about the TeX programming language](#the-tex-programming-language)
- [Learn about the Tectonic program](#the-tectonic-program)

To learn about ways you can contribute to the Tectonic community, mosey on
over to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page.

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-info"><b>If you need help</b>, try <a
href="https://tectonic.newton.cx/">the Tectonic forum</a> site. You can <a
href="https://tectonic.newton.cx/search">search prior discussions</a> for help
and post a new topic if no one seems to have run into your particular problem
before.</p>


## How to write LaTeX documents

If you’re just getting started as a TeX/LaTeX user, there are literally
hundreds of LaTeX tutorials out there. Try the
[LaTeX wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX), which is freely
available and is continually modified and improved. But if that doesn’t do the
trick for you, just
[use your favorite search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=latex+tutorial&t=h_&ia=web)
and explore.

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">The Tectonic authors have to admit
that it’s been a long, long time since they’ve needed a LaTeX tutorial, so
they’re not sure what the best resources are. Please pipe up on <a
href="https://tectonic.newton.cx/t/good-latex-tutorials/42">the relevant forum
thread</a> if you’ve got any suggestions!</p>

If you’re a more experienced user, the
[TeX/LaTeX StackExchange site](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) is an excellent
resource, with frequent contributions from the architects of LaTeX themselves.
But we’re more than happy to answer LaTeX questions on
[the Tectonic forum](https://tectonic.newton.cx/) too.


## The TeX programming language

TeX is a full-fledged computer programming language. You can write documents
without knowing its details, but you can achieve some very powerful effects if
you learn them.

The canonical reference is *The TeXbook*, written by the creator of TeX
himself, Donald Knuth. You can find it
[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TeXbook-Donald-Knuth/dp/0201134489) and
probably at
[your local library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/texbook-describes-tex-version-30/oclc/826569026&referer=brief_results)
too. Please be warned, though, that various parts of The TeXbook *are not
applicable to Tectonic* because it inherits numerous extensions to the
traditional TeX language provided by
[e-TeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/etex?lang=en),
[pdftex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdftex?lang=en), and
[XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/).

Also please know that **many people find The TeXbook to be extremely
unhelpful**. You can tell that it’s written by a mathematician, that’s for
sure. Unfortunately, we’re not aware of any alternatives that explain the
language in any comparable detail.

Once again, if you’re a more experienced user, the
[TeX/LaTeX StackExchange site](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) is an excellent
resource, and [the Tectonic forum](https://tectonic.newton.cx/) is a great
place to ask questions too.


## The Tectonic program

One day, this section will have a link to a nice manual for the Tectonic
program. Unfortunately, we haven’t written it yet.

In the meantime, [the Tectonic forum](https://tectonic.newton.cx/) is the
place to go: there are discussions that document some aspects of how the
Tectonic program works, and of course you can ask any questions that you might
have.
